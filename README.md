Solutions to Rosalind problems.
=====================

My solutions to exercises from rosalind.info/problems.

&nbsp;


These were done as a project to:
* practice python3 (working with files, learning how to use new modules, etc.)
* practice documenting (every script and def is documented)
* learn how to organize a project with many files
* learn how to use git and github
* etc.

If you have any corrections or suggestions please comment! In particular if you know a better way to do something please let me know!  I would also like feedback on my documentation and the readability of my code.
